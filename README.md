# Cache restore/store AFter git Checkout/ci Execution

`cafce` provides CI job side cache key calculation and cache management for S3 compatible API server.

## Motivation

Caching in GitLab CI/CD has a problem that cache restoring has occurred before executing git checkout.

This problem leads the limitation that only 2 blob expression is allowed for cache key file.

According to this GitLab CI/CD maintainer's post, calculating the cache key from files is executed on the GitLab server.  And the limitation comes from the server-side performance issue.

So, there is a simple solution that calculates the cache key on each CI job after executing git checkout.
